# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## The Repo

This repo is a day scheduling app to track productivity throughout the work day. It uses jquery, bootstrap, and momentjs to save whatever is written in each hour's textarea to the localstorage. It then color codes each block based on whether that hour is current, past, or future. I added a button to the top that allows a user to clear all data as well.

Future iteration may include a dark mode as well.
